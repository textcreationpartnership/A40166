            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Also of the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, how that he came into the World without the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the World, and how he denied them, and went out of the World without the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the World.</p>

            <p>THE Lord God <hi>breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi> Job saith;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7. Job. 18.10.</note>
               <hi>In the Lords Hand is the Soul of every living thing; and the Breath of all Mankind</hi> is the Breath of all <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women:</hi> And is not his <hi>Hand</hi> his <hi>Power?</hi> And again, <hi>Job</hi> saith: <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 33. v. 4. Psal. 33.6.</note>
               <hi>and the Breath of the Almighty hath given me Life.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>The Earth is full of the Goodness of the Lord; by the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Host of them by the Breath of his Mouth.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> saies; <hi>He trusted in the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 31.14, 15.</note>
               <hi>and his times were in his Hand.</hi> So you may see, how all things were made by the <hi>Word Christ Jesus,</hi> and who made them, to wit, the <hi>Lord;</hi> and Mans time is in the Lords Hand.</p>
            <p>And the Lord God, <hi>He that Created the Heavens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 42.5.</note>
               <hi>and stretched them out; he that spread forth the Earth, and that which comes out of it; be giveth Breath unto the People upon it, and Spirit to them that walk therein.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> saies:<note place="margin">Job 34.14.</note>
               <hi>God gathers to himself Mans Spirit and Breath.</hi> So God that gives Breath and Spirit unto Man, it is he that gathers his Breath and Spirit to himself again, who has all in his Hand.<note place="margin">Psal. 37.23.24.</note> And <hi>the steps of a good Man are ordered by the Lord, and he delights in his Way: though he fall, he shall not be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his Hand.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> saies: <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 104.</note>
               <hi>In wisdom hast thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy riches: the great and wide Seas, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great Beasts: These all wait upon thee, that thou maist give them their meat in due season, that thou givest them, they gather; thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens thy hand, and they are filled with good.</hi> So here you may see the Lord that Created all; how he takes care for all, and gives them their meat in due season. And all that keep their mind to the Lord with his Spirit, and so with it are acquainted, and his Hand, whose Breath is in his hand, they can say:<note place="margin">Psal. 118, 13, 14 15.</note>
               <hi>The Lord is my Strength,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56305:3"/>and is become my Salvation; and the Voice of rejoycing and salvation is in the Tabernacle of the Righteous;</hi> and can say, <hi>The Right Hand of the Lord doth valiantly, and is exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So every Man and Womans <hi>Hope</hi> must be in the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things therein, who keepeth Truth forever.</p>
            <p>And further,<note place="margin">Psal. 146.3, 4.5.</note>
               <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Put not your Trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help; his breath goes forth, he turneth to the Earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.</hi> Therefore all are to trust in the Lord, in whose hand is their breath and life.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. <hi>How by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the Lord hath founded the Earth, and by his understanding established the Heavens:</hi> and saith, <hi>how the length of days is in her Right Hand, and in her Left Hand is Riches for evermore.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this <hi>Wisdom</hi> into your hearts, which cries in the streets, if you will have her <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you may see in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> how the Lord encourages his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are sensible that they are the work of Gods Hand. He saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 64.8. c. 68.11. to the end.</note>
               <hi>That you may suck and be satisfied with the Breasts of her Consolations, that ye may milkout, and be delighted with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her</hi> (<hi>to wit</hi> Jerusalems) <hi>Glory. For thus saith the Lord, Behold I will extend peace unto her like a River, and the Glory of the Gentiles shall flow like a flowing stream: Then shall ye suck, ye shall be born and dandled upon her knees; as one whom his Mother comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>And when ye see this, your hearts shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an Herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his Servants.</hi> Is not this the <hi>Heavenly Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of all true Christians in the new Covenant, and new Testament?</p>
            <p>Now the breath of all Mankind is in the hand of the Lord, who made the World, and all things therein; <hi>seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, he dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands, &amp;c.</hi> who giveth breath and life to all things, as the Apostle says, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note>
               <hi>And who hath made of one blood all nations of men, that dwell upon the face of the Earth, that with his breath and life they should seek the Lord, and seel after him, and find him; though he be not far from every one of them: For in him we live and move, and have our Being,</hi> as some of the Heathen Poets could say.</p>
            <p>And now God that giveth breath and life to all Mankind, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56305:3"/>commands all men every where <hi>to Repent,</hi> that they might turn to him, serve and worship him, and praise him, who has Created them, and takes care for them both with his Temporal, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Blessings, opens with his <hi>Hand</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> and fills with his blessings: For <hi>God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in Righteousness by Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all you that have erred from the Spirit of God, and so from God, among the <hi>Witches</hi> or <hi>Fortune tellers,</hi> that tell people <hi>when and how they shall die;</hi> such were forbidden, and judged by the Lord in the Old Testament, and not to be followed or hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to. But God who gives <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to all Mankind, who hath their life and breath in his hand, and the length of their days; he saith, <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the Earth and be Ye saved:</hi> so with his <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>life</hi> they must look unto the Lord, from whence it comes, and be saved. So he that gives them <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> is the Creator, and hath their <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>life</hi> in his hand, and is the Saviour, from whom all have salvation; and they are to look unto the Lord for it, all the ends of the Earth, through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And Christ saith in his New Testament, when he encourages his Disciples, he bids them, <hi>Fear God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again he saith, <hi>Are not two Sparrows sold for a farthing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Luk. 12.4.9.</note>
               <hi>and not one of them is forgotten before God?</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> says, <hi>Not one of them shall fall on the ground without the Will of the Father. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows: for even the hairs of your head are all numbred (whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in Heaven, and before the Angels of God. But whosoever shall deny me before Men, him will I also deny before my Father, which is in Heaven, and before the Angels of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here ye may see, what Christ saith, that a <hi>Sparrow</hi> shall not fall to the ground without the Will of God: for not one of them is forgotten of God: so that neither with your <hi>Guns</hi> nor <hi>Nets</hi> ye can catch a <hi>Sparrow</hi> without the Will of God: for not one of them shall fall to the ground without the Father that made them. And therefore Mankind, to wit, Man and Woman, which are of more value than many <hi>Sparrows,</hi> are not forgotten of God, neither shall they fall to the ground without the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56305:4"/>For Christ saies, <hi>The hairs of your heads are numbred,</hi> to wit by the Lord that made them. And the Lord, who giveth them their breath, spirit and life, by which they become living souls to live to him, hath also their breath, and their Souls in his hand, yea of all Mankind, as in <hi>Job.</hi> And therefore the Eternal living God is to be feared by Men and Women all the daies of their lives that they may discern the times and seasons, that are in the Fathers hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is a discerning beyond the <hi>Hypocrites looking at the face of the Skies for fair weather and foul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Sparrows</hi> are not forgotten of God, and not one of them shall fall to the ground without the Will of the Father, as is said before; surely <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> are of more value than many <hi>Sparrows</hi> with the Lord, <hi>who hath numbred all the hairs of their heads,</hi> and gives them breath and life, by which they become living Souls, and hath all the breath of Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his <hi>Hand,</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> how can any one of them be forgotten, when the <hi>Sparrows</hi> are not, who sees and knows with his All-seeing Eye? Certainly not one of them shall fall to the ground without the Will of the Father, who hath all in his <hi>Hand,</hi> to wit, his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God has appointed <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> to uphold all things, by whom he made the World, who is the <hi>brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his substance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2, 3.</note>
               <hi>and upholds all things by the word of his Power.</hi> So he, by whom all things were made, is Heir of all things; and he upholding all things with the word of his Power, there is no <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>Fall</hi> of any thing without his Will and Word of his Power: and therefore every Man and Womans <hi>Faith</hi> must be in Christ, in the Son of God, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, by whom all things were made.</p>
            <p>For Christ saith to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8.24.</note>
               <hi>Ye are from beneath, and I am from above; Ye are of this World, and I am not of this World. For if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins.</hi> Now this is a bad dying for People to <hi>die in their Sin,</hi> that do not believe in Christ the Son of God, who is Heir of all things, and upholds all things by his Word and Power, by whom Men and Women, and all things were made. And such as <hi>die in their Sins,</hi> do not believe in him, who would redeem them out of <hi>Sin,</hi> who bruises the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, and destroys the Devil and his Works, and reconciles to God all things in one, both things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and is a Mediator betwixt God and Man, he that is from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56305:4"/>above, and is not of the World. And they which do not believe in Christ, that <hi>die in their Sin,</hi> they cannot sleep in Christ, when they put off their Earthly Tabernacle, nor die in the Lord.<note place="margin">Rev. 14.13.</note>
               <hi>For blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Spirit saith, that they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Christ hath taught you, how to believe, and what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, he saith, <hi>While you have the Light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 12.36. &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>believe in the Light, that ye may become the Children of the Light.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> in his 1st Chapter tells you what this <hi>Light</hi> is, who saith, <hi>The Light is the Life in Christ, the Word, by which all things were made and created, which enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> Now all Mankind being enlightned with the Light, which is the Life in Christ, the <hi>Word</hi> (who is Heir of all things, and upholds all things by his word and power, by whom all things were made) You that believe in his <hi>Light</hi> which is the Life in him, that is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and not of this world, You become <hi>Children of the Light,</hi> and not of the World, and are <hi>born of God,</hi> and do pass from the Death to life in Christ Jesus; and so are grafted in him your <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> and built upon him your <hi>Rock:</hi> and so Christ your <hi>Root</hi> bears you. Such die in the Lord when thy put off their Earthly Tabernacle, such sleep in Jesus, as the Apostle saith.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>For we know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes 4.14. 2 Cor. 5.10. &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> So this the true Christians were sure of, while they were in their Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles. <hi>For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our House, which is from Heaven, if so be that we being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, do groan, being burthened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up with Life.</hi> This should be every true <hi>Christians</hi> mind.</p>
            <p>This is the mind of all the Believers in the Light, the Life in Christ Jesus, by which all things were made and Created;<note place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> and as Christ saies; <hi>He that believeth in the Son of God, shall not perish, but have everlasting Life: and he that believeth not the Son of God, shall not see Life; but the Wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> For how can he see Life, if he doth not believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the Life in Christ, by whom all things were made and Created. And therefore Christ saith, <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World;</hi> and this <hi>Light</hi> is the Life in Christ, the <hi>Word,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56305:5"/>who is not of the World. And Men loving <hi>Darkness</hi> rather than this <hi>Light,</hi> because their deeds are Evil, then they love the <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> more than the <hi>Light,</hi> the Life in Christ, and more than <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Christ saith, <hi>Every one that doth Evil, hateth the</hi> Light, <hi>neither cometh be to the</hi> Light, <hi>lest his Deeds should be reproved.</hi> So they that do Evil, and hate the <hi>Light,</hi> will not come to the <hi>Light</hi> by which their Deeds are made manifest and reproved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such will not come to the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the Life in Christ, and this <hi>Light</hi> is their Condemnation, that do Evil, and hate it, and will not come to it to have their evil Deeds made manifest, and be reproved by it, as before.</p>
            <p>So they that do hate the <hi>Light,</hi> and will not have their evil Deeds reproved, and love the Darkness more than the <hi>Light,</hi> they love the <hi>Devil,</hi> the power of Darkness, more than God and Christ, who comes to destroy the <hi>Devil,</hi> and his Works, and bruise the Serpents head. <hi>But he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Heavenly Divine <hi>Light,</hi> which is the Life in Christ the <hi>Word,</hi> who is from above, is the <hi>Light</hi> by which all Men <hi>see,</hi> in whom their Deeds have been, and are wrought; so that Christ might very well say, <hi>If you do not believe that I am be <hi>(the Son of God)</hi> ye shall die in your Sins.</hi> For how can such, that do not believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Life in Christ,</hi> die in the Lord, or sleep in Christ Jesus?<note place="margin">Joh 8.</note> how can they <hi>die otherwise but in their Sins,</hi> (as Christ saith) and are condemned, and the Wrath of God abides upon them. And they that believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the Life in Christ, are grafted into him, and have Eternal Life: such are they that pass from Death to Life, and overcome the world, and shall not come into Condemnation.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.24.</note> For Christ saith, <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him, that sent me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation, but is past from Death unto Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 25.</note>
               <hi>For verily I say unto you, the hour coming, and <hi>Now is</hi>
               </hi> (mark <hi>Now is,</hi>) <hi>when the Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear, shall live.</hi> And they that will not hear, but love Darkness rather than <hi>Light,</hi> and will not come to the <hi>Light,</hi> nor believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> that they may become Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> how can they but <hi>die in their Sins,</hi> and <hi>perish in their Gain sayings and Corruptions?</hi>

               <hi>I have no pleasure at all that the Wicked should die;</hi> again, <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God; wherefore turn your selves, and live ye.</hi> Now when the Wicked <hi>die</hi> in their wickedness, they go from the Spirit of God in themselves, and so from God: and therefore the Lord God would have them turn again by his Spirit to him, who made them, and gives them breath and life, that they may not <hi>die in their Sins.</hi> And they that are led by the Spirit of God, which are the Children of the Lord, <hi>such die in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>sleep in Jesus.</hi> In such God, who is a Spirit, has <hi>pleasure</hi> with them in his Spirit, that live and walk in his Spirit, and die in the Lord. But he has no pleasure in them that hate the Light, the Life in Christ, whom he sent to enlighten them, and rebel against his Spirit, and so against God who gave it them, such <hi>die in their Sins,</hi> and perish in their Gain-sayings; in such God, who is a Spirit, has no <hi>pleasure.</hi> Those that rebel against his Spirit, rebel against him; for his <hi>pleasure</hi> is with them, while they live and <hi>walk in his Spirit, and his Light, and Truth and Grace.</hi>

               <hi>Love not the World nor the things that are in the World: If any man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the pride of Life is not of the Father, but of the World; And the World passeth away, and the Lust thereof; but he that doth the Will of God, abideth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you see here, what is of the <hi>World,</hi> and what is its <hi>Glory,</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> that overcame <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by his <hi>Lies</hi> in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them they should be as Gods, if they did eat that which God had forbidden.

               <hi>no Truth.</hi> But Christ the <hi>Truth</hi> bruiseth the Serpents head, and destroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works.</p>
            <p>And Christ set up a <hi>Worship</hi> in the Holy Spirit of God, and in the <hi>Truth</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> is out of; for there is <hi>no Truth</hi> in him, as Christ saith. So they that <hi>Worship</hi> God in his Spirit and Truth, <hi>Worship</hi> in that which the Devil is out of, and is not in him, neither can he get into it. And therefore that which is of the Devil, who is out of the Truth, the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which the Devil <hi>would</hi> have given to Christ, if he would have Worshipped him, is that, which is not of the Father, but of himself, <hi>the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life,</hi> which passes away. For God Almighty Created all things; <hi>and the Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof;</hi> and he gives the increase. So the <hi>Glory</hi> of all the Creatures and the <hi>Glory</hi> of all the Creation is the Lords, and he doth beautify them. For the Devil could not give Christ the <hi>Glory</hi> of a <hi>Thistle,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of a <hi>Nettle,</hi> nay, not the <hi>Glory</hi> of any <hi>Weed,</hi> for these are the Lords with the Earth and the Fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and the <hi>Glory</hi> of all his Creation is the Lords, who is God in Heaven and in the Earth to be served, and Worshipped above all.</p>

            <p>And likewise here you may see the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> would have given to Christ, which he had begotten in the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who

And so he was not like to <hi>take that</hi> which he was come to <hi>destroy,</hi> and which was not of his Father. Nor are his followers to receive that which is not of the Father, lest they worship the Devil, and go from Gods Holy Spirit and <hi>Truth,</hi> and love that which will keep the love of the Father out of them. And they that walk in the <hi>Truth,</hi> walk in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after the Lord Jesus Christ had gone through all his Temptings, and all the Revilings and evil Speeches from the <hi>Jews, Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees;</hi> and even his Preaching and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing himself to be the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by his Signs and Miracles; and when they by their wicked Tongues desired the <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and by wicked Hands had Crucified the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> (who were in the <hi>Murthering Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Pomps</hi> of the World) <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> a Counsellor (a good man, and just, who had not consented to the Counsel and Deeds of the Jews, who also himself waited for the Kingdom of God) went to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and beg'd the <hi>Body of Iesus,</hi> which they had Crucified betwixt <hi>two Thieves.

               <note place="margin">John 18.19.</note> And though <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and some of the Women did come, and brought their <hi>Myrrhe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury,</hi> yet when he went out of the world, he was buried by <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, to fulfil the Scripture, which says, <hi>he made his Grave with the such;</hi> but doth not say, that he had so much as a <hi>Coffin</hi> with a <hi>White</hi> and a <hi>black Cloth</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>So you may see here, our Lord and Saviour the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given unto him,</hi> he was not carried to his Sepulchre with a <hi>Gilded Coffin,</hi> with a <hi>great white and black Cloth over it, with Arms or Scutcheons upon it, and a many Priests and People following in black Cloths, and black Scarfs on their Hats, pretending mourning,</hi> and have <hi>Golden Rings given to them,</hi> and <hi>Twigs of siosemary in their hands,</hi> and <hi>ringing of Bells,</hi> which is more like going to a <hi>Wedding</hi> than to a <hi>Burying,</hi> in the <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the World. But instead of that, Christ had a company of <hi>Mockere;</hi> yea, the <hi>Chief-Priests, Scribes and Elders mockt</hi> him, saying; <hi>If he is the Son of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27.40, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>let him come down from the Cross, and we will believe him; he trusted in God, let him deliver him now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God: <hi>He saved others, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he cannot save.</hi> See what Blasphemy is here against <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> by Jews and the Priests, who in <hi>words</hi> profest <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Messias</hi> to come;<note place="margin">1 John, 2.23.24.</note> but in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> denied them both. <hi>For he that denieth the Son, hath not the Father; but he that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Son, hath the Father also. Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, If that which you have heard from the beginning, shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And all you that say. <hi>
                  <hi>That we Bury like Dogs,</hi> because that we have not superfluous and needless things upon our</hi> Coffin, <hi>and a</hi> white <hi>and</hi> black Cloth <hi>with</hi> Scutcheons, <hi>and do not go in Black, and hang</hi> Scarfs <hi>upon our Hats,</hi> and white Scarfs over our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. and <hi>give</hi> gold Rings, <hi>and have</hi> sprigs of Rosemary in <hi>our hands, and</hi> Ring <hi>the</hi> Bells. How dare you say that <hi>we Bury our People like Dogs</hi> because we cannot <hi>Bury</hi> them after the vain <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the world? whereas ye do not read, that Christ the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> our Lord and Saviour had any of these
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56305:8"/>things, neither when he came into the world, nor when he went out of the world; and refused the Pomp and Glory of the world, when the <hi>Devil</hi> tempted him with it.</p>
            <p>Now all People, come to learn of Christ, who hath enlightned you with the Life in himself, and believe in it, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Children of the Light: For <hi>Grace and Truth is come by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> into your hearts and Inward parts, that with his Grace and Truth you may learn of <hi>Christ, who is meek and low in the heart,</hi> and follow him, who is not of this world, and hear his voice, and he will lead you into the <hi>Pastures</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> He that came into the world not with any <hi>Pomp,</hi> nor <hi>Lust,</hi> nor <hi>Glory</hi> of the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he go out of the world with the <hi>Glory, Pomp</hi> or <hi>Lust</hi> of the world (as is said before) who was not of the world; who is the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> And therefore follow not the <hi>Pomps</hi> or Glory of the world at your <hi>Childrens</hi> coming into the world; nor breed them up in the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the world the time while they live, nor use them at going forth out of the world; but follow Christ Jesus, who is not of the world; who is your <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> your <hi>Saviour,</hi> your <hi>Way,</hi> your <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> your <hi>Bishop,</hi> your <hi>Shepherd,</hi> your <hi>Priest,</hi> your <hi>Prophet,</hi> and let him rule in your hearts by <hi>Faith,</hi> who will give you life abundantly, who is from above and not from below. That you may be built upon him the living <hi>Rock,</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that stands sure; <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> saith my Soul,</p>
